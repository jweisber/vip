# Odds & Ends

This repo houses a textbook for philosophy courses in probability and inductive logic: *Odds & Ends: Introducing Probability & Decision with a Visual Emphasis*.

The book is similar in coverage and level to some other well-known texts for such courses, especially *Choice & Chance* by Brian Skyrms, and *An Introduction to Probability & Inductive Logic* by Ian Hacking.

The book is open access, and is available in both [HTML](http://jonathanweisberg.org/vip/) and [PDF](https://github.com/jweisber/vip/raw/master/docs/_main.pdf).

It is also open source, so you can modify it to your liking. The source code is available in [this repository](https://github.com/jweisber/vip-source).
