<p><span class="newthought">We’ve been thinking a lot</span> about what conclusions our evidence supports. But a lot of reasoning is <em>practical</em>: it’s not just about what to believe, but about what you should <em>do</em>. Once you know how likely the various possible outcomes of a decision are, how do you make your choice?</p>
<div class="problem">
<p>
Suppose you have a free ticket to play one game at the local casino. You can choose either the Coin Game or the Die Game.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Coin Game: a fair coin is flipped. You win <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span></span> if it lands heads, nothing otherwise.
</li>
<li>
Die Game: a fair die is rolled. You win <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span></span> if it lands five or six, nothing otherwise.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Which game should you play?
</p>
</div>
<p>The Coin Game has better odds: a <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> chance of winning vs. just <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> in the Die Game. But the Die Game promises a bigger payoff: <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span> rather than just <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>. So there are conflicting arguments here. The odds favour the first choice, while the potential payoffs favour the second. How do you reconcile these considerations and come to a decision?</p>
<p>Well, let’s think about what would happen in the long run if you played each game over and over.</p>
<p>Suppose you played the Coin Game over and over, a hundred times. Half the time you’d win <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>, and half the time you’d win nothing. So after a hundred plays, you’d probably win about <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span>, which is an average of <span class="math inline">\(\$0.50\)</span> per play.</p>
<p>Now suppose you played the Die Game a hundred times instead. A third of the time you’d win <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span>, and the other two thirds of the time you’d win nothing. So after a hundred plays you’d have won about <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>, an average of about <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> per play.</p>
<p>In technical terms, this means the Die Game has a higher <em>expected value</em>. In the long run, you’d expect to win about <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> per play in the Die Game, as opposed to <span class="math inline">\(\$0.50\)</span> for the Coin Game.</p>
<p>So the Die Game is the more advantageous one, on this analysis. On average, people tend to win more playing that game.</p>
<div id="expected-monetary-values" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Expected Monetary Values</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To</span> calculate the expected value of an option, we multiply each payoff by its probability, and then sum up the results. For example, our analysis of the Coin Game can be written this way:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \p(\$1) \times \$1 + \p(\$0) \times \$0 &amp;= (1/2)(\$1) + (1/2)(\$0)\\
      &amp;= \$0.50.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
And for the Die Game:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \p(\$3) \times \$3 + \p(\$0) \times \$0 &amp;= (1/3)(\$3) + (2/3)(\$0)\\
      &amp;= \$1.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Sometimes a gamble has the potential to lose money, so we use a negative number for the “payoff”. For example, suppose the Die Game is modified so that you have to pay <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span> if the die lands <span class="math inline">\(1, 2, 3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. Then we calculate:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \p(\$3) \times \$3 + \p(-\$3) \times -\$3 &amp;= (1/3)(\$3) + (2/3)(-\$3)\\
      &amp;= -\$1.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In general, the formula for a game with possible payoffs <span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\$y\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[ \p(\$x) \times \$x + \p(\$y) \times \$y. \]</span></p>
<p>Notice that expected values aren’t necessarily what you might think from the name. The expected value of a game isn’t necessarily the amount you expect to win playing it. If you play the Die Game, you’ll either win <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span> or nothing. But the expected value is <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>. So you actually know for certain ahead of time that you won’t win the expected value, <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>
The expected value isn’t the amount you expect to win from a game. It’s the amount you expect to win <em>on average, in the long run</em>, if you play the game over and over.

</p>
<p>There are two rectangular regions, one for each possible outcome. The width of each rectangle is the probability of the corresponding outcome, and the height is the payoff. So each rectangle’s area is one term in the expected value’s sum:
<span class="math display">\[ 1/3 \times \$2 + 2/3 \times \$6. \]</span>
The expected value is thus the area of the two rectangles together, i.e. the area of the blue region (about <span class="math inline">\(\$4.67\)</span> in this example).</p>
<p>The Coin Game and the Die Game are visualized in Figure <a href="expected-value.html#fig:coindiegame">11.2</a>.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">We</span> started this chapter wondering how to reconcile conflicting arguments. The Coin Game has better odds, but the Die Game has a greater potential payoff.</p>
<p>Well, a rectangle’s area can be enlarged by increasing either its width or its height. Likewise, a payoff’s contribution to expected value can be increased either by increasing its amount or by increasing its probability.</p>
<p>So the expected value formula answers our opening question by giving equal weight to the two competing factors. Width (probability) and height (payoff) are treated the same: neither one is given greater weight. We just multiply one against the other and take the total area that results.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Sometimes</span> a decision loses money. We use negative dollar amounts to represent losses. For example, imagine the Coin Game is modified so that you lose <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> if the coin lands tails. Then the expected value is:
<span class="math display">\[ 1/2 \times \$1 + 1/2 \times -\$2 = -\$1/2.\]</span></p>
<p>In our diagrams, potential losses extend below the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. And we colour them red as a reminder that they are to be subtracted from the area above the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.

<p>For example, suppose a fair die will be rolled and you will win $1 if it lands on a low number, $2 if it’s a middling number. If it’s a high number, you lose $3. Then:
<span class="math display">\[

          &amp;= \$0.

<p>Gambles with more than two outcomes are visualized the same as before. We just use three or more reactangles, one for each possible outcome.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> Fair Prices</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Imagine</span> a variation of the Coin Game, where you win <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> if the coin lands heads, and you pay <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> if it lands tails.

<span class="math display">\[

\]</span>
If you played over and over again, you’d break even in the long run. Half the time you’d win a dollar, and the other half of the time you’d pay a dollar back.</p>
<p>So if someone asked you to pay in order to play this game, that would seem unfair. Why pay to play if you don’t expect to win?</p>
<p>But for a game like the Die Game, asking people to pay to play does seem fair. In the long run, the casino is going to lose an average of <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> per play. So it’s only fair that they ask people to pay <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> to play that game. In the long run they’ll break even. (Of course, a real casino will demand more so they can turn a profit.)</p>
<p>In general, a game’s fair price is thought to be its expected value. If the expected value is <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span>, it’s fair to pay <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span> to play. If the expected value is <span class="math inline">\(-\$3\)</span>, it’s fair to “pay” <span class="math inline">\(-\$3\)</span> to play. Meaning <em>they should pay you</em> <span class="math inline">\(\$3\)</span> to play.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">Notice</span> that the expected value of paying the fair price is always <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span>. Suppose you pay <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> to play the original Die Game, for example. Because $1 is automatically deducted from your winnings, the possible consequences are now <span class="math inline">\(\$3 - \$1 = \$2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\$0 - \$1 = -\$1\)</span>. So the expected value of paying $1 to play is:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    (1/3)(\$2) + (2/3)(-\$1) &amp;= \$2/3 - \$2/3\\
      &amp;= \$0.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>That makes sense: if it’s a fair price, you shouldn’t have any advantage over the casino. You don’t stand to gain or lose money in the long run, if you pay the fair price to play over and over.</p>
<p>The casino is in the same position. For them, the losses and gains are reversed: a roll of five or six loses them $3, and otherwise they lose nothing. So if you pay them <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> to play, they either lose <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> in the end or gain <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    (1/3)(-\$2) + (2/3)(\$1) &amp;= -\$2/3 + \$2/3\\

<p>We don’t even have to put in the probabilities to make our decision here. Option <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is clearly better, because it has a better payoff no matter how the die lands. In every column, row <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a larger payoff than row <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a better decision no matter what.</p>
<p>When one option has a better payoff than another no matter what happens, we say the first option <strong><em>dominates</em></strong> the second. In terms of a table, the dominant option has a higher payoff in every column.</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
If <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></span> dominates <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></span>, then <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></span> must have higher expected value than <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>Dominant options don’t come up very often in practice. Real decision problems tend to be harder than that. But they do come up sometimes. (They’re also important in more advanced, theoretical topics: <a href="dutch-books.html#dutch-books-1">Chapter 17</a> covers one example.)</p>

<li><p>What is the expected monetary value of playing a slot machine that costs <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span> to play, and has a <span class="math inline">\(1/25\)</span> chance of paying out <span class="math inline">\(\$500\)</span>? (The rest of the time it pays nothing.)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose a slot machine pays off <span class="math inline">\(\$25\)</span> a fiftieth of the time and costs a <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> to play, and a video poker machine pays off <span class="math inline">\(\$10\)</span> a twentieth of the time and costs <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> to play.

<li><p>A local casino offers a game which costs <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> to play. A fair coin is flipped up to three times, and the payouts work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the coin lands heads on the first toss, you win <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span> and the game is over.</li>
<li>If the coin lands heads on the second toss, you win <span class="math inline">\(\$4\)</span> and the game is over.</li>
<li>If the coin lands heads on the third toss, you win <span class="math inline">\(\$8\)</span> and the game is over.</li>

<li><p>Suppose the government is deciding whether to create a vaccination program to prevent a potential epidemic of Zika virus. If there is an epidemic, it will cost the country <span class="math inline">\(\$1,000\)</span> million (for medical care, lost work-hours, etc.).

<li><p>Suppose Ontario is deciding whether to enact a new tax. If the tax is enacted, it will bring in <span class="math inline">\(\$700\)</span> million in revenue.</p>
<p>But it could also hurt the economy. The chance of harm to the economy is small, just <span class="math inline">\(1/5\)</span>.

<li><p>Suppose you play poker with five of your friends every week, but you’re not very good. For every week you win, there are eight weeks where you lose. You don’t play for real money though, so it’s usually no big deal.</p>

<li><p>Consider the following game: I’m going to flip a fair coin up to three times. If it comes up heads on the first toss, the game is over and you win <span class="math inline">\(\$2\)</span>.

<li><p>Consider the following game. I’m going to roll a fair die up to two times. If it comes up 1 on the first roll you win $<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the game is over. Otherwise, I roll it again. If it comes up 2 on the second roll, you win $<span class="math inline">\(6x\)</span> and the game is over. Otherwise you pay me $6 and the game is over. What does <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> have to be for this game to be fair?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following game.</p>
<p>I draw a card from a fair deck. If it’s a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, you pay me <span class="math inline">\(\$x\)</span>
times the face value: <span class="math inline">\(\$2x\)</span> if it’s a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\$3x\)</span> if it’s a <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the first card is neither a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> nor a <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, I draw a second card. If

<li><p>Suppose there are three urns, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Each urn has <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> marbles: some are black, the rest are white. You don’t know how many black marbles there are in each urn. But you do know two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has twice as many black marbles as <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has twice as many black marbles as <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span> is a fair price for the following game. I pick an urn at random and draw a marble at random. If I pick a black marble from urn <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> you win <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>. If I pick a black marble from urn <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> you win <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span>. If I pick a black marble from urn <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, you win <span class="math inline">\(\$25\)</span>. Otherwise you win nothing.</li>

<li><p>You’re on a game show where there are three closed doors. One of the doors has a large cash prize behind it, though you don’t know how much exactly. The other two doors have nothing. You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: Choose a door at random and keep whatever you find, if anything.</li>
<li>Option <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>: First ask the host to open one of the doors with nothing behind it. Then choose one of the remaining doors at random. The catch is that now you only get to keep <em>half</em> of what you find, if anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which option has higher expected value? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Hint: first calculate the expected value of each option if the cash prize is <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>. Then do the same calculations for a prize of <span class="math inline">\(\$1,000\)</span>. Then explain how to generalize this reasoning to any cash prize.</p></li>
<li><p>Some workplaces hold a weekly lottery. Suppose there are 30 people in your workplace lottery, and each person pays in $5 every Monday. A finalist is chosen at random every Friday, for three weeks. Then, on the fourth Friday, one of the three finalists from the previous three weeks is chosen at random. That person gets all the prize money.</p>
<p>What is the expected value of being in this lottery? Explain the reasoning behind your answer.</p>
<p>Tip: it’s possible to answer this question without doing any calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that paying the fair price for an option always results in expected value of <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span>. In other words, if <span class="math inline">\(E(A) = \$x\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E(\mbox{Pay } \$x \mbox{ for } A) = \$0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> dominates <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has higher expected value: <span class="math inline">\(E(A) &gt; E(B)\)</span>.</p></li>
