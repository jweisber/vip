<p><span class="newthought">Imagine</span> your university’s student union is holding a lottery. There are a thousand tickets, and the prize is <span class="math inline">\(\$500\)</span>. Tickets cost <span class="math inline">\(\$1\)</span>. Would you buy one?</p>
<p>The expected monetary value of buying a ticket is <span class="math inline">\(-\$0.50\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \E(T) &amp;= (1/1,000)(\$499) + (999/1,000)(-\$1)\\
          &amp;= -\$0.50.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
So it seems like a bad deal.</p>
<p>But some people do buy tickets in lotteries like this one, and not necessarily because they’re just bad at math. Maybe they enjoy the thrill of winning, or even just having a shot at winning. Or maybe they want to support the student union, and foster fun and community on campus.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">Suppose</span> your friend is one of these people. How might they respond to the calculation above? One thing they could do is replace the dollar amounts with different numbers, numbers that more accurately capture their personal values.</p>
<p>Instead of just a <span class="math inline">\(\$499\)</span> gain for winning, for example, they might use <span class="math inline">\(599\)</span>, to capture the added value that comes from the thrill of winning. And instead of <span class="math inline">\(-\$1\)</span> for losing, they might put <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> to capture the contribution to campus community that comes from participating in the event.</p>
<p>Then the calculation looks like this:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \E(T) &amp;= (1/1,000)(599) + (999/1,000)(9)\\
          &amp;= 9.59
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
So buying a ticket has positive expected value now.</p>
<p>Notice how there are no dollar signs anymore. In fact there’s no explicit unit of measurement at all. So what do these numbers represent, if not monetary value?</p>
<p>They represent how good or bad an outcome is, from your friend’s point of view. In decision theory we call these numbers <strong><em>utilities</em></strong>, or <strong><em>utils</em></strong> for short.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">If</span> the real value of something is its utility, we should calculate <em>expected utilities</em> instead of expected monetary values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Expected Utility</dt>
<dd><p>Suppose act <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has possible consequences <span class="math inline">\(C_1, C_2, \ldots,C_n\)</span>. Denote the utility of each outcome <span class="math inline">\(U(C_1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U(C_2)\)</span>, etc. Then the <em>expected utility</em> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is defined:
<span class="math display">\[ \EU(A) = \p(C_1)\u(C_1) + \p(C_2)\u(C_2) + \ldots + \p(C_n)\u(C_n). \]</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the formula for expected utility is exactly the same as for expected monetary value, except we replace dollars with utils.</p>
<p>According to standard decision theory, the right choice is the act that has the highest expected utility. Or if there’s a tie for highest, then any of the acts tied for highest is a good choice.</p>
<div id="subjectivity-objectivity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Subjectivity &amp; Objectivity</h2>

Some prioritize professional success, others favour activism. Some people like ’80s music, others prefer hip-hop—and still others, to my constant surprise, enjoy reggae.</p>
<p>So the value of a decision’s outcome depends on the person. It is <em>subjective</em>. And that raises a big question: if utility is subjective, how can we measure it objectively? Does it even make sense to treat personal tastes and preferences using mathematical equations?</p>

Luckily the idea was rediscovered by economists and statisticians in the <span class="math inline">\(1940\)</span>s.<!--</p>-->
<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>The classic solution to this problem was discovered by the philosopher Frank Ramsey in the <span class="math inline">\(1920\)</span>s. The key idea is to quantify how much a person values a thing by considering how much they’d risk to get it.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you have three options for lunch: pizza, salad, or celery. And let’s suppose you prefer them in that order: pizza <span class="math inline">\(\gt\)</span> salad <span class="math inline">\(\gt\)</span> celery. We want to know, how does salad compare to your best option (pizza) and your worst option (celery)? Is salad almost as good as pizza, for you? Or is it not so great, almost as bad as celery perhaps?</p>
<p>Here’s how we find out. We offer you a choice, you can either have a salad or you can have a gamble. The gamble might win you pizza, but you might end up with celery instead.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: Salad.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>: A gamble, with probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(P)\)</span> of pizza and <span class="math inline">\(1-\p(P)\)</span> of celery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is, how high does the probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(P)\)</span> have to be before you are <em>indifferent</em> between these two options? How good does your shot at pizza have to be before you’d trade the salad for the gamble, and risk winding up with celery instead?</p>
<p>This is a question about your personal tastes, notice. Some people really like salad, they might even like it as much as pizza. So they’d need the shot at pizza to be pretty secure before they’d give up the salad. Others don’t care much for salad. Like me: I’d be willing to trade the salad for the gamble even if the chances of pizza weren’t very high. For me, salad isn’t much better than celery, but pizza is way better than both of them.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose for the sake of example that your answer is <span class="math inline">\(\p(P) \geq 1/3\)</span>. You’d need at least a <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> chance at the pizza to risk getting celery instead of salad. Since celery is the worst option, let’s say it has utility zero: <span class="math inline">\(\u(C)=0\)</span>. And since pizza is the best option, let’s say it has utility one: <span class="math inline">\(\u(P)=1\)</span>. What is the utility of salad <span class="math inline">\(\u(S)\)</span> then?</p>
<p>

<p class="caption marginnote">-->Figure 12.2: A utility scale for lunch options<!--</p>-->
<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>We know that you’re willing to trade the salad for the gamble when the probability of winning pizza is at least <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>. So if <span class="math inline">\(\p(P) = 1/3\)</span>, the utility of salad is the same as the expected utility of the gamble: <span class="math inline">\(\u(S) = \EU(G)\)</span>. Therefore:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(S) &amp;= \EU(G)\\
      &amp;= \p(P)\u(P) + \p(C)\u(C)\\
      &amp;= (1/3)(1) + (2/3)(0)\\
      &amp;= 1/3.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
So salad has utility <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span> for you.</p>
<p>Hey look! We just took something personal and subjective and gave it a precise, objective measurement. We’ve managed to quantify your lunch preferences.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote">-->Figure 12.3: A friend’s utility scale for lunch options<!--</p>-->
<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p><span class="newthought">Now</span> imagine your friend gives a different answer. They’d need at least a <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> chance at the pizza to risk ending up with celery instead of salad. So for them, <span class="math inline">\(\u(S) = \EU(G)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\p(P) = 2/3\)</span>. So now the calculation goes:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(S) &amp;= \p(P)\u(P) + \p(C)\u(C)\\
      &amp;= (2/3)(1) + (1/3)(0)\\
      &amp;= 2/3.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
So for your friend, salad is closer to pizza than to celery. For them it has utility <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-general-recipe" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> The General Recipe</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Lunch</span> is important, but how do we apply this recipe more broadly? How do we quantify the value a person places on other things, like career options, their love life, or their preferred music?</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-21" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-21" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">What are <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></span> and <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span></span>? What are the best and worst options a person could have? I like to think of them as heaven and hell: <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></span> is an eternity of bliss, <span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(W\)</span></span> is an eternity of suffering.</span>
<span style="display: block;">That way we can look at the big picture. We can quantify a person’s utilities in the grand scheme of things. We can compare all kinds of life-outcomes, big and small. We can measure the utility of everything from raising happy and healthy children, to landing your dream job, to going on a Carribean vacation, to having a cup of coffee.</span>
<span style="display: block;">But it’s important to remember that the best and worst outcomes vary from person to person. In fact, for most people eternal bliss (heaven) isn’t the best possible outcome. They’ll want their friends and family to go to heaven too, for example. They may even want everyone else to go to heaven—even their enemies, if they’re a particularly forgiving sort of person.</span></span></p>
<p>Here’s the general recipe. We start with our subject’s best possible consequence <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and their worst possible consequence <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. We assign these consequences the following utilities:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(B) &amp;= 1,\\
    \u(W) &amp;= 0.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
Then, to find the utility of any consequence <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we follow this recipe. We find the <em>lowest</em> probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(B)\)</span> at which they would be indifferent between having <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> for sure vs. accepting the following gamble:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>: probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(B)\)</span> of getting <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\p(B)\)</span> of getting <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we know consequence <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has utility <span class="math inline">\(\p(B)\)</span> for them.</p>
<p>Why does this method work? Because our subject is indifferent between having option <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> for sure, and taking the gamble <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. So for them, the utility of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the same as the expected utility of the gamble <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. And the expected utility of gamble <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is just <span class="math inline">\(\p(B)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(C) &amp;= \EU(G)\\
          &amp;= \p(B) \u(B) + (1-\p(B)) \u(W)\\
          &amp;= \p(B).
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="newthought">I</span> find it helps to think of this method as marking every point on our utility scale with a gamble, which we can use for comparisons.</p>

</p>
<p>For every utility value <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, there’s a gamble whose expected utility is also <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. To find such a gamble, we make the possible payoffs <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, and we set <span class="math inline">\(\p(B) = u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\p(W) = 1 - u\)</span>.</p>
<p>These gambles give us points of comparison for every possible utility value <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> on our utility scale. Figure <a href="utility.html#fig:uscale">12.4</a> shows a sample of a few such points. We can’t show them all of course; there are infinitely many, one for every number between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now to find the utility of an outcome—whether it’s a salad, a Carribbean vacation, or a million dollars—we find which of these gambles it’s comparable to. To locate a Carribbean vacation on our scale, for example, we move up the scale from 0 until we hit a gamble where our subject says, “There! I’d be willing to trade a Carribbean vacation for that gamble there.” Then we look at what <span class="math inline">\(\p(B)\)</span> is equal to in that gamble, and that tells us their utility for a Carribbean vacation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Choosing Scales</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">This</span> method for quantifying utility assumes that <span class="math inline">\(\u(W) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\u(B) = 1\)</span>. What justifies this assumption? It’s actually a bit arbitrary. We could measure someone’s utilities on a scale from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> instead.

<p>It’s just convenient to use <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.

<p>It’s also inuitive to use the same <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-to-<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> scale for both probability and utility. It makes our visualizations of expected utility especially tidy. Expected utility can then be thought of as portion of the unit square. The best possible option is a <span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span> chance of the best outcome, i.e. probability 1 of getting utility <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. So the best possible choices have area <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Whereas the worst gamble has no chance of getting any outcome with positive utility, and has area <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">You</span> can think of the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> endpoints like the choices we make when measuring temperature. On the celsius scale, the freezing point of water is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> degrees and the boiling point is <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>. On the Fahrenheit scale we use <span class="math inline">\(32\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(212\)</span> instead. The celsius scale is more intuitive, so that’s what most people use. But the Fahrenheit scale works fine too, as long as you don’t get confused by it.</p>
<p>Notice, by the way, that a person’s body temperature is another example of something personal and subjective, yet precisely and objectively measurable. Different people have different body temperatures. But that doesn’t mean we can’t quantify and measure them.</p>

<div id="a-limitation-the-expected-utility-assumption" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> A Limitation: The Expected Utility Assumption</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">A</span> measurement is only as good as the method used to generate it. An oral thermometer only works when the temperature in your mouth is the same as your general body temperature. If you’ve got ice cubes tucked in your cheeks, or a mouthful of hot tea, even the best thermometer will give the wrong reading.</p>
<p>The same goes for our method of measuring utility. It’s based on the assumption that our subject is making their choices using the expected utility formula. When the probability of pizza <span class="math inline">\(\p(P)\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>, we assumed you were indifferent between keeping the salad and taking gamble on pizza/celery because <span class="math inline">\(\u(C) = \EU(G)\)</span>.</p>
<p>But people don’t always make their choices according to the expected utility formula. Some famous psychology experiments demonstrate this, as we’ll see in <a href="challenges-to-expected-utility.html#challenges-to-expected-utility">Chapter 13</a>. So it’s important to keep in mind that our “utility thermometer” doesn’t always give the right reading.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote">-->Figure 12.6: The diminishing value of additional money<!--</p>-->
<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>For most people, gaining more money adds less and less value as the gains increase. In graphical terms, the relationship between money and utility looks something like Figure <a href="utility.html#fig:dolutil100">12.6</a>.</p>
<p>We can quantify this phenomenon more precisely using our technique for measuring utilities. For example, let’s figure out how much utility a gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> has, compared with <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>.</p>
<p>As usual we set the end-points of our scale at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(\$0)   &amp;= 0,\\
    \u(\$100) &amp;= 1.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span>
Then we ask: how high would <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> have to be before you would trade a guaranteed gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> for the following gamble?</p>
<ul>
<li>Chance <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> of winning <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>, chance <span class="math inline">\(1-\p(\$100)\)</span> of winning <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I’d only be willing to take the gamble if <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100) \geq .85\)</span>. So, for me, <span class="math inline">\(\u(\$50) = .85\)</span>.
<span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \u(\$50) &amp;= \p(\$100)\u(\$100) + \p(\$0)\u(\$0)\\
             &amp;= (.85)(1) + (.15)(0)\\
             &amp;= .85.
  \end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice how this fits with what we said earlier about the value of additional money. At least for me, <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span> isn’t twice as valuable as <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span>. In fact it’s not even really close to being twice as valuable. A gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> is almost as good as a gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>: it’s <span class="math inline">\(.85\)</span> utils vs. <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> util.</p>
<p>But what about you: how does a gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> compare to a gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span> in your life?</p>

The gamble has a <span class="math inline">\(9/10\)</span> chance of winning, in which case Sonia gets the Beyoncé tickets (utility <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). Otherwise she gets the Katy Perry tickets (utility <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>).</p>
<p>If Sonia declines the gamble, what can we conclude?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is <span class="math inline">\(9/10\)</span>.</li>
<li>For Sonia, the utility of seeing The Weeknd is greater than <span class="math inline">\(9/10\)</span>.</li>

<li><p>After giving her calculus midterm, Professor X always offers her students a chance to improve their grade by trying to solve an optional “challenge” problem. If they get it right, their grade is increased by one letter grade: F changes to D, D changes to C, etc. But if they get it wrong, their grade goes down by one letter-grade: A changes to B, B changes to C, etc.</p>
<p>Hui got a C on his midterm. He asks the professor how often students get the challenge problem right and she says they get it right half the time. Hui decides to stick with his C. But he would be willing to try the challenge problem if the chances of getting it right were higher: <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> or more.</p>
<p>Suppose getting a D has utility <span class="math inline">\(4/10\)</span> for Hui, while a B has utility <span class="math inline">\(8/10\)</span>.</p>

<li>What is the expected utility for Hui of trying the challenge problem?</li>

<li><p>Let’s explore how much value you place on money. We’ll only consider amounts between <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>, and we’ll set our scale as usual: <span class="math inline">\(\u(\$100) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\u(\$0)=0\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Now suppose you are offered a gamble that has probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> of paying <span class="math inline">\(\$100\)</span>, and probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\p(\$100)\)</span> of paying <span class="math inline">\(\$0\)</span>. How high would <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> have to be for you to be willing to trade a guaranteed <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> for this gamble?

<li>Now consider a gamble that has probability <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> of paying $100, and probability <span class="math inline">\(1-\p(\$100)\)</span> of paying <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span>. How high would <span class="math inline">\(\p(\$100)\)</span> have to be for you to be willing to trade a guaranteed <span class="math inline">\(\$75\)</span> for this gamble? (This is another question about your personal preferences.)</li>
<li>Based on your previous answers, how much utility does gaining <span class="math inline">\(\$75\)</span> have for you?</li>
<li>In terms of dollars, a gain of <span class="math inline">\(\$75\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times as large a gain as <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span>. In terms of your utilities, how does <span class="math inline">\(\u(\$75)\)</span> compare to <span class="math inline">\(\u(\$50)\)</span>? Is it more than <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span> times as large? Less? The same?</li>
<li>Make a graph with dollars on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and your utilities on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. Plot the four points established in this problem. Then use them to draw a rough sketch of how your utilities increase per dollar.</li>

<li><p>Martha is trying to decide where to go to university. She applied to three schools: UTM, Western, and Queens. UTM is her first choice, Queens is her last choice.</p>
<p>So far Martha has only heard back from Western. They are offering her early admission: they’ll admit her but only if she agrees right now to go there (she can’t wait until she finds out if the other two schools will admit her).</p>
<p>Based on her grades, Martha knows that if she waits she’ll be admitted to Queens for sure. But her chance of getting into UTM is only <span class="math inline">\(6/10\)</span>.</p>
<p>After thinking about it a while, she can’t decide: a guaranteed spot at Western seems just as good to her as the gamble on UTM vs. Queens.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the utility of going to Queens is <span class="math inline">\(5/10\)</span> for Martha, and the utility of going to UTM is <span class="math inline">\(9/10\)</span>, what is the utility of going to Western?</li>
<li><p>Martha’s friend is considering York University. Martha didn’t apply to York, but if she had she would be indifferent between these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept an early-admissions offer from York and go there.</li>
<li>Gamble on a <span class="math inline">\(3/4\)</span> chance at going to Western vs. a <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> chance of having to go to Queens.</li>

<li><p>Eleanor wants to get a job at Google so she’s going to university to study computer science. She has to decide between UTM and Western.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(1/100\)</span> of UTM’s computer science students get jobs at Google and the rest get jobs at RIM. For Eleanor, a job at Google has utility <span class="math inline">\(200\)</span> while a job at RIM has utility <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is the expected utility of going to UTM for Eleanor?</li>

On the other hand, the remaining <span class="math inline">\(35/400\)</span> of them don’t get a job at all, which has utility zero for Eleanor.</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How much utility does working at Amazon have for Eleanor?</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose Eleanor ends up going to UTM, and now she’s about to graduate. Unfortunately, Google isn’t hiring any more. The only jobs available are at Amazon and RIM.</p>
<p>She would have to take a special summer training program to qualify for a job at Amazon, though. And that would mean she can’t get a job at RIM. RIM is offering her a job, but she has to take it now or never.</p>
<p>So, she has to either take the guaranteed job at RIM right now, or gamble on the summer program. The summer program could get her a job at Amazon, or it could leave her unemployed.</p>

On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(1/10\)</span> of them don’t get a job at all, which has utility <span class="math inline">\(-50\)</span> for Farad.</p>

<p>Farad ends up going to Western and now he’s about to graduate. Unfortunately, his grades aren’t very good, so he would have to do a special summer program to get into law school. Alternatively he can apply to medical school or teacher’s college, where he would definitely get in.</p>
<p>Farad has to choose between (i) taking the summer program, and (ii) going to medical school or teacher’s college. He won’t have time to do both. So if the summer program doesn’t get him into law school, he’ll end up unemployed.</p>
